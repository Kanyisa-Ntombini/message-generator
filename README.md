# Harry Potter Message Generator

![Use Case Diagram](./harrypotter.jpg)

## What is the project about?

This is a Harry Potter themed message generator. A message will be randomly generated where a user will be told which Hogwarts house they belong to, the type of pet they have, their favourite subject and a quote from the books.

## Features
I created a webpage that displays the messages. I've finished the structure of it using HTML. I used JavaScript to make the webpage interactive. I am currently studying the CSS section. As I learn new concepts I will improve the styling.
